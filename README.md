A Timed Hollywood Trivia Game

When this game is launched, users are presented with a start button to begin the game. Ten questions will be presented sequentially, with thirty seconds being allotted for the completion of each question. If the timer finishes or an answer is chosen, the question's correct answer will be revealed along with a relevant picture. The timer operates by way of a setTimeout function, and the countdown is displayed to the user with the help of a setInterval function. 

Currently, each question is contained within its own function. Work is underway to refactor this code into a cleaner object for faster processings and easier-to-modify code.
